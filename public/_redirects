# REDIRECTS CONFIGURATION
# ========================
# This file is currently empty because your project is configured for Server-Side Rendering (SSR).
#
# WARNING: A catch-all rule like "/* /index.html 200" is for Single Page Applications (SPA) only.
# Adding it here would BREAK your site because the homepage is dynamically rendered on the server,
# so there is no static "index.html" to serve for all routes.
#
# If you eventually switch to 'output: static' in astro.config.mjs, you can uncomment the line below:
# /*  /index.html  200

# Redirects 301 - Servicios eliminados (micronicho)
/servicios/*  /  301
/servicios    /  301
